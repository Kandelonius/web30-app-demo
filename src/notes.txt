Problem Solving Approach
* Understand the problem
* Concrete Examples
* Break it down
* Solve or simplify
* Look back and refactor

1) Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2) What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3) what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4) Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
   - May not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth 
   considering the question at this early stage
5) How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Patterns-
*Frequency Counter
*Multiple Pointers
*Sliding Window
*Divide and Conquer
*Dynamic Programming
*Greedy Algorithms
*Backtracking
